:: A script to set up and run the full application (backend and frontend) on Windows.
:: It handles Python and Node.js dependencies and runs both servers in separate windows.
::
:: V6: Added 'call' before 'pip install' and 'npm install'.
::     Without 'call', the script would transfer execution to npm/pip
::     and never return to this script, causing it to stop prematurely.

ECHO --- The Small App Setup ---

:: --- Step 1: Environment File Check ---
ECHO.
ECHO [1/5] Checking for environment file...
IF NOT EXIST "api\.env" (
    ECHO No .env file found in the 'api' directory.
    IF EXIST ".env.example" (

        ECHO Please open this file and fill in your API keys and S3 bucket details.
        ECHO After saving your changes, please run this script again.

    goto end

:: --- Step 3: Backend Setup ---
ECHO.
ECHO [3/5] Setting up Backend (API)...

:: --- Step 4: Frontend Setup ---
ECHO.
ECHO [4/5] Setting up Frontend (Client)...

:: --- Step 5: Run Application ---
ECHO.
ECHO [5/5] Starting Application...

ECHO Starting FastAPI server in a new window...
:: Change directory to the API folder first.
:: The 'start' command will make the new window inherit this directory as its starting path.
cd /d "%~dp0api"

ECHO Starting SvelteKit dev server in a new window...
:: Change directory to the client folder first.
cd /d "%~dp0client"
start "SvelteKit Frontend" cmd /k "call npm run dev -- --port 9998"

:: Return to the script's root directory
cd /d "%~dp0"

ECHO Waiting for servers to initialize...
timeout /t 5 /nobreak > nul

ECHO.
ECHO ðŸš€ Application is running in separate windows!
ECHO ------------------------------------------
ECHO Backend API available at: http://localhost:9999
ECHO Frontend available at:   http://localhost:9998 (or another port if 9998 is busy)
ECHO ------------------------------------------

ECHO To stop the application, simply close the two new command prompt windows that were opened.
ECHO This main script window can be closed now.
